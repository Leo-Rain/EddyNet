If you want to try, I recommend EddyResNet over EddyNet.

# Convolutional Neural Networks for the Segmentation of Oceanic Eddies from Altimetric Maps

I am updating the repo with new code and results from the article "Convolutional Neural Networks for the Segmentation of Oceanic Eddies from Altimetric Maps" submitted to Remote Sensing. Preprint can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328837669_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_the_Segmentation_of_Oceanic_Eddies_from_Altimetric_Maps) 

I already made public some jupyter notebooks and data to let anyone start using it.
